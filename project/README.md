# California Tsunami Risk

## Project Description

In this project, I will experiment with the simulation of tsunamis to observe their impact on California and the Bay Area in particular.

I aim to answer the following questions with this project:
**Is it reasonably possible for the Bay Area to be hit by a Tsunami?**
