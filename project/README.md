# California Tsunami Risk

## Project Description

In this project, I will experiment with the simulation of tsunamis to observe their impact on California and the Bay Area in particular.

I aim to answer the following science question with this project:

*Is it reasonably possible for the Bay Area to be hit by a Tsunami?*

In order to answer this question I will construct a model of the ring of fire, where subduction zone plate boundaries surround the Pacific Ocean. I will run several tsunami simulations in different locations on subduction zones with tsunami size being determined by a realistic estimation of movement from an earthquake at that point. I anticipate that there will be a combination of the location of the earthquake and the size of the earthquake that will cause the resulting tsunami to hit the Bay Area at a moderate intensity. 

For the initial conditions, I will use the most recent available ECCO Version 5 Model in December 2017. I will also construct the boundary and external forcing conditions based on this same ECCO Version 5 data. In order to analyze and visualize the results, I will create a movie for each simulation, showing the location of the tsunami on an hourly/semi-hourly rate as it travels across the Pacific. I may also create a graph of the water height in the Bay area to get a more detailed picture of the impact of a tsunami in the area.
